As you hover over images, you will know if the phone recognizes an image
if image metadata displays on the top left corner of the phone screen.

If there is metadata in the left corner, then you have the option of
"selecting" / "interacting" with the object by tapping on the screen.
On top, a menu should open up. At this point, the client will stop
sending preview frames to the server. You can then click on
any of the options. You will need to press the Android back key to
return to the menu mode. To exit the menu mode, tap on the screen
anywhere not on the menu. Now preview frames will resume being sent
to server.

NOTES:
* The Android menu key has been disabled. The only way to get a menu
for an image is to tap on the screen when it has been recognized.
* The only way to "exit" the application is to press the Android home
key. But this will not shut down any server connections (it will stop
sending preview frames though). To completely exit, you need to shut
down the task using an Android app such as TaskControl.
* Only been tested on HTC Aria running 2.2
